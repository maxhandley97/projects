    <p> Sticky Fingers are band formed in the inner-west suburbs of Sydney in the late 2000's. </p>
    <p>They have heavy Surf-Rock and Reggae undertones, many arguing they're a white reggae band</p>
    <p> Littered with Controversy in the last few years, after Frost, the Band's lead singer, made it to the news one too many times.
